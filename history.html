        <h2>The History of Ganesh Chaturthi</h2>
        <p>
          Ganesh Chaturthi marks the birthday of Lord Ganesh, celebrated with
          grandeur across India. The festival has historical significance and
          cultural relevance, symbolizing new beginnings and the removal of
          obstacles.

            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>
              Although it is unknown when (or how) Ganesh Chaturthi was first
              observed,[21] the festival has been publicly celebrated in Pune
              since the era of King Shivaji (1630–1680, founder of the Maratha
              Empire).[21][better source needed] The Peshwa in the 18th century
              were devotees of Ganesha and started as a public Ganesh festival
              in their capital city of Pune during the month of Bhadrapad.[22]
              After the start of the British Raj, the Ganesh festival lost state
              patronage and became a private family celebration in Maharashtra
              until its revival by Indian freedom fighter and social reformer
              Lokmanya Tilak.[21][23] Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak,[24]
              championed it as a means to circumvent the colonial British
              government ban on Hindu gatherings through its anti-public
              assembly legislation in 1892. Lokmanya Tilak started the festival
              in Pune and Girgaon, Mumbai. [25][26][27] I followed with the
              greatest curiosity crowds who carried in procession an infinite
              number of idols of the God Ganesh. Each little quarter of the
              town, each family with its adherents, each little street corner I
              may almost say, organizes a procession of its own, and the poorest
              may be seen carrying on a simple plank their little idol or of
              paper mâché... A crowd, more or less numerous, accompanies the
              idol, clapping hands and raises cries of joy, while a little
              orchestra generally precedes the idol. – Angelo de Gubernatis,
              Bombay Gazette (1886)[28][29] According to others such as Kaur,
              the festival became a public event later, in 1892 when Bhausaheb
              Laxman Javale (also known as Bhau Rangari), installed the first
              sarvajanik (public) Ganesha idol in Pune.[30] In 1893, the Indian
              freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak praised the celebration of
              Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav in his newspaper, Kesari, and dedicated
              his efforts to launch the annual domestic festival into a large,
              well-organised public event.[31] Tilak recognised Ganesh's appeal
              as "the god for everybody",[32] and according to Robert Brown, he
              chose Ganesha as the god that bridged "the gap between Brahmins
              and non-Brahmins", thereby building a grassroots unity across them
              to oppose British colonial rule.[33] Other scholars state that the
              British Empire, after 1870 out of fear of seditious assemblies,
              had passed a series of ordinances that banned public assembly for
              social and political purposes of more than 20 people in British
              India, but exempted religious assembly for Friday mosque prayers
              under pressure from the Indian Muslim community. Tilak believed
              that this effectively blocked the public assembly of Hindus whose
              religion did not mandate daily prayers or weekly gatherings, and
              he leveraged this religious exemption to make Ganesh Chaturthi to
              circumvent the British colonial law on large public
              assembly.[24][25][27] He was the first to install large public
              images of Ganesha in pavilions in Bombay Presidency, and other
              celebratory events at the festival.[34] God Ganesh: political
              obstacle remover Why shouldn't we convert the large religious
              festivals into mass political rallies? —Lokmanya Tilak, Kesari, 8
              September 1896[35] [note 1] According to Richard Cashman, Tilak
              recruited and passionately committed himself to god Ganesha after
              the 1893 Hindu-Muslim communal violence in Bombay and the Deccan
              riots, when he felt that the British India government under Lord
              Harris had repeatedly taken sides and not treated Hindus fairly
              because Hindus were not well organised.[40] In Tilak's estimate,
              Ganesha worship and processions were already popular in rural and
              urban Hindu populations, across social castes and classes in
              Baroda, Gwalior, Pune and most of the Maratha region in the 18th
              century.[41] In 1893, Tilak helped expand Ganesh Chaturthi
              festival into a mass community event and a hidden means for
              political activism, intellectual discourse, poetry recitals,
              plays, concerts, and folk dances.[42] In Goa, Ganesh Chaturthi
              predates the Kadamba era. The Goa Inquisition had banned Hindu
              festivals, and Hindus who did not convert to Christianity were
              severely restricted. However, Hindu Goans continued to practice
              their religion despite the restrictions. Many families worship
              Ganesha in the form of patri (leaves used for worshiping Ganesha
              or other gods), a picture is drawn on paper or small silver idols.
              In some households Ganesha idols are hidden, a feature unique to
              Ganesh Chaturthi in Goa due to a ban on clay Ganesha idols and
              festivals by the Jesuits as part of the Inquisition.[43]

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>
              Fast forward to today, and Ganesh Chaturthi has grown into a
              spectacle of enormous proportions. The once simple observance has
              become a dazzling public festival, celebrated with grandeur across
              cities and towns. The transformation reflects both the changing
              dynamics of urban life and the growing influence of media and
              technology. Modern celebrations see towering, elaborately
              decorated idols of Lord Ganesha paraded through streets adorned
              with vibrant lights and elaborate pandals (temporary structures).
              The scale of the festival has expanded dramatically, with massive
              processions and a blend of traditional and contemporary music
              filling the air. Homes and public spaces are transformed into
              colorful, ornate settings for the festival. The idols themselves
              are larger than life, crafted from a variety of materials
              including plaster of Paris and fiberglass, and are often adorned
              with intricate decorations and LED lights. The Challenges of Idol
              Makers Behind the glitz and glamour, however, lies a world of
              challenges faced by Ganesh idol makers. For many artisans, the
              festival is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a
              significant source of income; on the other, it comes with its own
              set of difficulties. Traditional clay idol makers, or “murtikars,”
              face increasing competition from mass-produced, synthetic idols
              which are often cheaper and more visually striking. The shift away
              from clay idols poses environmental concerns as synthetic
              materials can be harmful when they are immersed in water after the
              festival. Moreover, the production cycle is intense. Artisans
              start preparing for the festival months in advance, working long
              hours to meet the demand. The process involves not only crafting
              the idols but also ensuring they meet the aesthetic expectations
              of buyers who seek ever more elaborate and grand designs. The Joy
              of Making and Selling Despite the challenges, Ganesh idol makers
              find immense satisfaction in their craft. For many, it is a labor
              of love, deeply rooted in cultural heritage and personal devotion.
              The preparation of each idol is imbued with a sense of reverence
              and anticipation for the festival. Local markets and workshops
              buzz with activity as artisans sculpt, paint, and decorate the
              idols. Vendors display their creations in bustling markets, and
              the festive spirit is palpable. Buyers flock to these markets,
              selecting idols that resonate with their personal devotion and
              aesthetic preferences. During the festival, the streets come alive
              with vibrant processions. Devotees carry the idols to water bodies
              for immersion, a practice that symbolizes the cycle of creation
              and dissolution. This final ritual brings closure to the festival
              and marks the return of Ganesha to his celestial abode, only to be
              welcomed again the following year.
