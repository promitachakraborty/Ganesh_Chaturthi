        <h2>How Ganesh Chaturthi is Celebrated</h2>

        <p>
          During Ganesh Chaturthi, which spans over 10 days, daily rituals play
          a crucial role in the celebration of Lord Ganesh. These rituals vary
          slightly depending on regional practices and personal preferences, but
          they generally follow a traditional sequence. Hereâ€™s a detailed look
          at the everyday rituals observed during Ganesh Chaturthi:
        </p>

        <h2>Day 1: Ganesh Chaturthi (The Arrival of Ganesh)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Preparation and Installation:</strong> The Ganesh idol is
          brought home or to the community pandal. The space is cleaned and
          decorated with flowers, lights, and rangoli (colorful patterns made on
          the floor).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ganesh Puja:</strong> The ritual begins with Ganesh Puja,
          which includes the chanting of mantras, offering of flowers, and
          sweets like modaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kalash Puja:</strong> A kalash (sacred pot) filled with water
          and adorned with mango leaves and a coconut is placed beside the
          Ganesh idol. It is a symbol of prosperity and divine presence.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 2-9: Daily Rituals</h2>
        <h3>Morning Rituals:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Aabhishek (Bathing the Idol):</strong> The idol is bathed with
          water, milk, honey, and other sacred substances. This is followed by a
          gentle wiping of the idol.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Offerings (Naivedya):</strong> Devotees offer special food
          items to Lord Ganesh. These offerings usually include fruits, sweets,
          and snacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Aarti:</strong> Aarti (a ritual of waving a lighted lamp) is
          performed, accompanied by devotional songs (bhajans) and the ringing
          of bells.
        </p>

        <h3>Afternoon Rituals:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Prayers and Hymns:</strong> Recitation of Ganesh Chaturthi
          prayers and hymns like Ganapati Ashtakshara Mantra and Ganapati
          Atharvasirsha.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Chanting and Meditation:</strong> Devotees engage in chanting
          Ganesh mantras and meditation to seek blessings and guidance from Lord
          Ganesh.
        </p>

        <h3>Evening Rituals:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Cultural Activities:</strong> Public pandals often organize
          cultural performances such as dance, drama, and music. This may also
          include storytelling about Lord Ganesh's legends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Community Offerings:</strong> Community feasts and
          distribution of prasad (sacred food) are held. In homes, family
          members gather for a communal meal.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 10: Anant Chaturdashi (The Immersion Day)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Final Puja:</strong> On the last day of the festival, a final
          puja is performed to bid farewell to Lord Ganesh. This includes
          offering final prayers and aarti.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Procession and Immersion (Visarjan):</strong> The Ganesh idol
          is taken out in a grand procession, accompanied by singing, dancing,
          and festive music. The idol is then immersed in a river, lake, or sea.
          This symbolizes the return of Lord Ganesh to his celestial abode.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Post-Immersion Rituals:</strong> After immersion, devotees
          often participate in clean-up drives to restore the surroundings.
